# Pakon Raw Converter

Windows only, Net Core 3.1 [runtime needed](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/current/runtime). 

Image converter from the Pakon scanner raw format. Drag and drop pakon raw files into the window and it will convert them into 16bit png files.

The color correction in the software will set the white point, set the gamma, adjust the colors somewhat, increase the saturation and contrast slightly. 
It is not intended as a one stop shop, but more getting the image into the correct ballpark.

The converted files will be saved in the same folder as the raw files are in.

Works corrently with base16 files only, and you have to use the TLXDemoClient software to get the raw files.
